## Frequentist vs. Bayesian
Frequentists and Bayesians look at different things, the frequentists rather look at the frequency of some event A whereas Bayesians look at the degree of believe, that some event A occurs.  
Bayesians can also look at unique events that can't be repeated (e.g. "Germany wins the World Cup 2018") as the integrate prior assumptions/ knowledge into the calculation of the probability. So what a Bayesian needs to do is to specify a prior and together with the likelihood that is given by the data achieves a posterior distribution.  
These two approaches make a difference in the results we can get from them and the possibility we have. So does the frequentist approach with calculating p-values help researchers to reject a null hypothesis, but it isn't useful to consider other hypotheses.

For a good and more detailed explanation of the differences between the two approaches have a look [here](http://blog.keithw.org/2013/02/q-what-is-difference-between-bayesian.html).

### Explanations for the methods used in subtab "Coin Flips"

In this tab we will have a look at coin flips. You can choose k and N(=how many heads (k) out of N flips) and a theta which specifies the bias you want to look at. So e.g. by choosing theta = 0.5 we will look at the case that the coin is fair, so the probability of getting a head or a tail is equal, it is 0.5.  
You can analyse this input data in different ways:   

1. Calculate the p-value  
Here we calculate the p-value,which "is defined as the probability of obtaining a result equal to or "more extreme" than what was actually observed, assuming that the null hypothesis is true." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value#Definition_and_interpretation)  
For a p-value which is less than a certain threshold $\alpha$ (which is often .05), we talk about a significant p-value and we would then reject the null hypothesis we had (in our case that the coin is fair/ unbiased).
You can decide whether to fix N or k. Fix N would mean that you look at an experiment where it was clear at the beginning that we're going to throw the coin N times and the variable we wanted to determine was k. The same case for fix k - here we would have said from the beginning, that we will throw the coin as long as it takes until we got k heads and we would look at how many flips we needed for this amount of heads.
  
2. Model comparison  
Here we compare two models by calculating the so-called [Bayes-Factor BF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor). Hereby the coefficent of the probability of both models given the data is formed. The higher the coefficient the better is the model in the numerator compared to the model in the denominator.
  
3. Estimation
What we do here is, that we calculate a HDI for our posterior distribution and look whether the ROPE lies inside/outside/ in- and outside of the HDI. Hereby the ROPE is a small region around our parameter $\theta$.
In our case, if we take a beta distributin as prior (e.g. $\alpha _{prior}$ = $\beta _{prior}$ = 1 as a "flat prior") we can get the posterior distribution really easy, it is again a beta distribution with the following parameters:  
$\alpha _{posterior}$ = $\alpha _{prior}$ + k  
$\beta _{posterior}$ = $\beta _{prior}$ + N − k  
For this distribution we can then calculate the HDI and see how the relationship between the ROPE and the HDI is.  If the ROPE lies entirely outside of the HDI of the posterior, we can reject the value $\theta$, if it lies entirely inside the HDI we can say, that the value $\theta$ is believable. If some parts lay inside and some parts lay outside, we can't make a real statement.

Für das Tab zur Estimation, noch den Plot erklären und was man einstellen kann bzw eventuell auch nochmal was die ROPE sache da bedeutet?

hier seine Grafik hin? und dann aber auch schreiben, dass das von ihm ist?

Depending on which statements you want to make either the one or the other are a good way to analyse the data.
