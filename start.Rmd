**Hey! We're happy, that you're interested in learning more about the differences between Bayesian and Frequentist Data Analysis!**
**This app is organised in the following parts:**

**1) On the subpage "Frequentist vs. Bayesian", you'll get a short introduction and further information about the theory behind the analyses that are performed on the other subpages**  
**2) The second subpage "Coin Flip Data" allows you to specify a coin flip experiment in terms of the resulting number of heads/tails and further specifications for the methods we look at.**    
**3) The third subpage "Bivariate Normal Data" allows you to specify a correlation. Then, you cam look at the linear model for a bivariate data set calculated from this correlation and the Bayes factor for this linear model.**
